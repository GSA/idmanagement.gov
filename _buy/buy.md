Find approved products and services for Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) implementations, and helpful links for purchasing these items using GSA Schedules.

Other current and planned products and services can be found on the [GSA ICAM Solutions Catalog and GSA ICAM Roadmap]({{site.baseurl}}/buy/icamsolutions/).

# Products

The FICAM testing program – also known as the [Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program]({{site.baseurl}}/fips201/) – tests commercial products used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKI). These products are tested and approved to ensure you're buying products that provide value and work well together.

The **Approved Products List (APL)** contains the official list of these tested products. There are currently two approved product cagtegories:

1. [PIV Cards]({{site.baseurl}}/approved-products-list-piv/)
2. [Physical Access Control Systems]({{site.baseurl}}/approved-products-list-pacs-products/)

**Why can't I find a category or product?**
A product is removed when it has lost its certification due to security concerns. It is placed on the [Removed Products List (RPL)]({{site.baseurl}}/buy/removed-products-list/). 
2.A category is deprecated after it has reached broad adoption or maturity. Any further testing is no longer needed (for example, card readers for logical access). A deprecated category is not the same as a removed product. Deprecated categories are [shared through a FIPS 201 Program announcement]({{site.baseurl}}/sell/fipsannouncements). [Contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/contact-us/) if you’re unsure if a product is fit for government use.

## PACS Implementer Self-Assessment Toolkit

The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program in collaboration with the [PACS Modernization Working Group](https://www.idmanagement.gov/governance/ficam/#icamsc-working-groups){:target="_blank"} created an operational self-assessment tool. The tool helps PACS implementers assess facility access systems that use PIV credentials. The assessment provides results to show alignment or disparity to FICAM and NIST guidelines.
