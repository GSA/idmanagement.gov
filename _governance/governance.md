The Federal ICAM (FICAM) program helps federal agencies plan and manage enterprise identity, credentialing, and access management (ICAM) through collaboration opportunities and guidance on IT policy, standards, implementation, and architecture. Most of the guidance and best practices found on this website are developed through interagency working groups.

## ICAM Program Management Guide

The [ICAM Program Management Guide](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/pm/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} explains how to plan and implement an Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Program, as outlined in the [Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Architecture](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/arch/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. In this guide, you’ll find content for ICAM program managers who need agency-level planning guides to drive adoption of ICAM services within their organizations as well as information on how to govern the program, identify and communicate with stakeholders, manage risk, and other related topics.

This guide answers the most common ICAM program organization and management questions, including:
- How can I establish governance to ensure ICAM alignment at the agency level?
- Who are my key ICAM stakeholders?
- What best practices support ICAM implementation?

The guide is organized by sections, each of which describes an essential feature of ICAM program management, including recommendations and lessons learned from agencies who have implemented ICAM programs.

## FICAM Playbooks

The FICAM Roadmap, developed by the Federal CIO Council, contains processes, procedures, and considerations for planning and managing logical access, physical access, identity management, and federation within federal agencies. But the Roadmap was last updated in 2011, and as technology, policy, and security practices rapidly evolve, the government must also evolve. To modernize the original FICAM Roadmap, we’ve begun migrating this information to playbooks. 

These playbooks are hosted on Github and provide common policy and patterns to help you implement and execute ICAM at your agency. The playbooks are a government-wide collaboration based on the needs and interests of individual agencies and government-wide groups. Reach out to icam at gsa.gov to suggest new topics.
