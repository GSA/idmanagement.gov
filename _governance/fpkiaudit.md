This page contains information to help Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) program managers and auditors.
- It includes the FPKI policies and profiles as well as annual FPKI annual review schedule.
- It can help auditors assess certification authorities (CAs) operated as part of the FPKI. 
- It can help the general public understand how the FPKI Management Authority (FPKIMA) provides trusted PKI and CA operations.

For any questions, please contact fpki at gsa.gov.


## FPKI Policies and Profiles

The Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) provides the government with a trust framework and infrastructure to administer digital certificates and public-private key pairs. For more information on the FPKI and PIV, go to the:
- [FPKI Guide](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/fpki/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [PIV Guide](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/piv/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

The [FPKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA)]({{site.baseurl}}/governance/ficam/#federal-public-key-infrastructure-policy-authority) maintains two certificate policies (the Common Policy Framework and the Federal Bridge). All cross-certified CA certificate policies are mapped to the Federal Bridge certificate policy.

The FPKI has the following supplementary guidance:

- [Security Controls Overlay of NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 Security Controls for FPKI Systems (PDF, February 2021)]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-overlay-sp-800-53.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} – The application of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 security controls is required to operate a CA that is used in the FPKI and contains federal data. Review the controls overlay document to understand the requirements and details of each applicable control.
- [FPKI Key Recovery Policy (PDF, October 2017)]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-key-recovery.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - The FPKI Key Recovery Policy (KRP) supplements the FPKI Certificate Policies and describes the procedural and technical security controls needed to operate a Key Recovery System (KRS) securely, in accordance with FPKIPA requirements.
- [Registration Authority Agreement Template v1.0 (Word, April 2017)]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-ssp-raa.docx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - The purpose of this document is to identify and explain the roles and responsibilities of an enrollment/registration agent under the Federal PKI COMMON Policy Framework.
- [FPKI Incident Management Plan (PDF, September 2020)]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-imp.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - This document provides guidance on the roles and responsibilities applicable to the FPKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA), FPKI Management Authority (FPKIMA), and FPKI affiliates in the event of an incident. 
- [Archived copies of Certificate Polices, Profiles, and other FPKI-related documents]({{site.baseurl}}/governance/fpkiarchive/) - This pages contains three years of FPKI-related documents.


## Annual Review Requirements for All Certification Authorities

Independent compliance audits are the primary way that the Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKIPA) ensures that entities participating in the FPKI comply with the requirements identified in the appropriate Certificate Policies (CPs). Audits are an important component of the Annual Review Requirements.

Audits are required annually for supporting functions and elements of each entity.  Annual review packages should be submitted to fpki at gsa.gov.

- [FPKI Annual Review Requirements (PDF, May 2022)]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-annual-review-requirements.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} – This document includes requirements for performing and reporting annual compliance audits.
- [RA Audit Guidance Memorandum (PDF, October 2022]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-ra-audit-guidance.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} – This FPKIPA Memorandum reiterates the necessity of RA audits in supporting PKI operations, normalizes differing terminology used across various references, and provides options for reducing potential duplication of RA audit efforts, as applicable to PIV issuers.
- PIV and PIV-I Annual Testing - supports FPKI Annual Reviews and can be done either in person at the GSA FIPS 201 Lab or using available tools such as the [Card Conformance Tool (CCT)](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/fpki/tools/cct/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/fpki/tools/cpct/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Non-Compliance Management Framework For The Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) (PDF, January 2016)]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/fpki-nmf.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - This document provides guidance for the FPKI Policy Authority (FPKIPA) for responding to situations in which an FPKI FBCA member is not meeting their Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) requirements and obligations.
