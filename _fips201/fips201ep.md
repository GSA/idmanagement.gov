The Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program (sometimes called the FICAM Testing Program) tests and certifies services and commercial products used in PIV credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKIs).

For the latest testing news, view the [program announcements]({{site.baseurl}}/fips201/fipsannouncements/).

## Testing and Certification

We test and certify a variety of products and services such as:

- Smart cards (secure elements) used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and Common Access Card (CAC) credentials
- Physical access control systems for buildings including readers and infrastructure
- Service providers who manage, install, or provide hosted solutions for issuance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and CAC credentials

If you’re looking for testing procedures related to products not listed above, review the [announcements]({{site.baseurl}}/fips201/fipsannouncements/). Over the years, some product testing has been deprecated to eliminate redundancy, or the product categories have become stable and represent general commercial use products.

### Product Testing

Product testing is performed by either:

- Third-party accredited testing labs, OR
- GSA-managed testing labs

If the product passes testing and review, the vendor is granted a letter of certification, and the product is placed on the [Approved Products List (APL)]({{site.baseurl}}/acquisition-professionals/#products). The APL includes product information, version, date of certification, and special considerations.

Visit the [Vendors page]({{site.baseurl}}/vendor/) for more on testing and certification.

## Testing Guidance and Documents

Functional requirements for the products are outlined in each test procedure. Review the testing agreements, and the test procedure for your specific product, and submit the agreement and package to fips201ep at gsa.gov.

## Derived PIV Credentials

Agencies that wish to issue D-PIV credentials should follow these steps:
1. Perform a NIST SP 800-79 assessment and receive an Authority To Operate (ATO)
2. Work with your Shared Service Provider (SSP) to obtain D-PIV Object Identifiers (OIDs)
3. Submit sample D-PIV public certificates for testing or provide results from the [Certificate Profile Conformance Tool (CPCT)]({{site.baseurl}}/fpki/tools/cpct/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to fips201ep at gsa.gov.

Upon successful completion of DPCI testing, the agency or organization will be granted approval to issue D-PIV credentials.

## Physical Access Control System

GSA tests and validates the interoperability of PIV and CAC credentials with the software and hardware used to restrict physical access to government facilities. 

Review the test procedures, choose one of the application packages, and submit to fips201ep at gsa.gov.
