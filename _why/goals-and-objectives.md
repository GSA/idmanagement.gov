The Goals and Objectives identify the aims and outcomes of a federal agency enterprise ICAM program. The goals and objectives align with ICAM functions and map to government-wide policies, cross-agency priorities, and strategic government initiatives.

**Goals** are aspirational statements designed for senior government leaders, agency executives, and agency ICAM program leadership responsible for setting program strategy. **Objectives** are action areas where agency execution strategies, action plans, and performance metrics can be developed based on alignment with mission needs.

The visual below presents the three goals, each with its own objectives.
