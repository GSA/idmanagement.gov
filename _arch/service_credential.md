Credential Management is how an agency issues, manages, and revokes credentials bound to enterprise identities.

A credential is a data structure that authoritatively binds an authenticator to an existing identity using one or more identifiers. An employee or contractor uses an authenticator with a password or cryptographic module to assert their identity.

The following are types of authenticators:

- Something you know, like a password or PIN.
- Something you have, like a private key or One-Time Password (OTP) generator.
- Something you are, like a fingerprint or iris. 

The Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) determines the authenticators associated with a credential. Federal government-wide policy requires a minimum Authenticator Assurance 
Level 2 for employees and contractors.

The following are some examples of credentials:

- You might use a PIV credential that includes a picture, the issuing agency logo, and cryptographic key pairs to assert your identity at a federal facility.
- You might use a combination of credentials, like a username/password with a one-time password generated by a mobile application, to assert your identity to a federal web 
application.

Unlike identities, credentials can expire. If an enterprise identity continues past a credential’s expiration date, the issuing agency can issue a new credential.
