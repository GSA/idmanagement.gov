# Introduction

FICAM is the federal government’s implementation of Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM).

> **_ICAM_** is the set of tools, policies, and systems that an agency uses to enable the **_right individual_** to access the **_right resource_**, at the **_right time_**, for the **_right reason_** in support of **_federal business objectives_**.

This version of the FICAM Architecture encompasses the **enterprise** ICAM policies, technologies, and system approaches for government employees, contractors, and authorized partners. Citizen interactions with the federal government - or consumer ICAM - are not covered under this version of the FICAM Architecture.

The following diagram is a high-level view of the ICAM practice areas and supporting elements. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/intro_ConceptualDiagram.png" alt="A diagram with definitions and icons for identity, credential, and access management and definitions for federation and governance." width="870" height="352">

The FICAM Architecture includes government-wide enterprise architecture views with the flexibility to support each agency’s unique business or mission needs. Use the FICAM Architecture as a tool to continuously improve upon your agency’s approach and align with federal security and privacy initiatives.

Copy the graphics and text throughout this playbook to use at your agency to drive ICAM awareness, strategy developments, and communications.

## What Is ICAM?

ICAM is the set of tools, policies, and systems that an agency uses to enable the right individual to access the right resource, at the right time, for the right reason in support of federal business objectives.

Agencies implement ICAM services and solutions to unify their IT services, improve physical access control, and improve information security and decisions. Understanding the building blocks of ICAM is key to understanding the FICAM Architecture. ICAM has three practice areas and two supporting elements. The supporting elements enhance the capabilities of the practice areas.

## What Is the FICAM Architecture?
FICAM is the federal government’s enterprise approach to design, plan, and execute common ICAM processes.

The FICAM Architecture is a framework for an agency to use in ICAM program and solution roadmap planning. The FICAM Architecture focuses on enterprise identity processes, practices, policies, and information security disciplines. 

>  A federal enterprise identity is the unique representation of an employee, contractor, or enterprise user, which could be a mission or business partner, or even a device or technology managed by a Federal agency to achieve its mission and business goals [(OMB Memorandum 19-17)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Who Is the FICAM Architecture for?
The FICAM Architecture is for agency personnel. An enterprise architecture is primarily used by:
- **Senior Federal IT and Agency Stakeholders** to understand the concepts for identity and access management services and the basic use cases supporting business objectives.
- **Program Managers** to find common definitions and frameworks for use in planning.
- **Enterprise and Application Architects** to use a common framework for designing and governing IT systems, applications, and implementations.

There are four main governmentwide initiatives to help agencies implement and manage an Agency ICAM program and technology.

  1. **Planning and Configuration Guidance** The FICAM Architecture and accompanying [playbooks]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/) provides an overall guide for meeting federal ICAM requirements in an efficient and secure way. It focuses on enterprise identity processes, practices, policies, and information security disciplines. Playbooks offer stakeholders overarching strategies and tactical approaches for implementing technical FICAM topics.
  2. [Interagency Forum and Subcommittee]({{site.baseurl}}/ficam/#icam-governance-bodies): The Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council is a primary resource for identity management, secure access, authentication, authorization, credentials, privileges, and access lifecycle management. The ICAM Subcommittee aligns identity management activities of the federal government and supports collaborative government-wide efforts.
  3. [Approved Products Lists (APL)]({{site.baseurl}}/fips201/): The Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program not only tests commercial products for use in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures but also publish APLs. Federal acquisition professionals rely on these APLs to purchase commercial products that fully comply with federal ICAM mandates.
  4. [Federal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)]({{site.baseurl}}/university/fpki/): The Federal PKI is a network of certification authorities (CAs) that issue PIV credentials and person identity certificates; PIV-Interoperable credentials and person identity certificates; and other person identity certificates. CA-issued digital certificates, which employ cryptography, close security gaps in user identification and authentication, encryption of sensitive data, and data integrity.

## What Is the History of the FICAM Architecture?
The FICAM Architecture was created in 2009 to provide a common ICAM segment architecture for federal agencies. The FICAM Architecture was the primary foundation of what later became the _FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Plan_ enhanced with complementary implementation sections.  

In 2015, ICAM experts from across the federal government collaborated on an updated FICAM Architecture.  This update was intended to be more concise, easy to understand, and visually appealing while reflecting the latest updates in cybersecurity, enterprise architecture, and ICAM policy and technology.

This site contains the current version for the FICAM Architecture.  The FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0 is superseded by both the FICAM Architecture updates and other complementary modernized playbooks developed by ICAM committees across government. 

# Goals and Objectives

The Goals and Objectives identify the aims and outcomes of a federal agency enterprise ICAM program. The goals and objectives align with ICAM functions and map to government-wide policies, cross-agency priorities, and strategic government initiatives.

**Goals** are aspirational statements designed for senior government leaders, agency executives, and agency ICAM program leadership responsible for setting program strategy. **Objectives** are action areas where agency execution strategies, action plans, and performance metrics can be developed based on alignment with mission needs.

The visual below presents the three goals, each with its own objectives.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/all_goals.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/all_goals.png" alt="Three boxes that define the goals and their corresponding objectives.">
</a>

**Goal 1: Modernize security policies and solutions to make risk-based decisions, automate identity and access management processes, and move access protections closer to government data.**

- 1.1 Review, update, and maintain comprehensive ICAM policies and technology solution roadmaps to inform and enforce enterprise strategic planning, risk management, and modernization.
- 1.2 Adopt and use cloud-ready systems that provide an efficient and secure way to access resources.
- 1.3 Monitor and respond to user behavior and events by using data as a strategic asset to make adaptive and risk-based decisions.

**Goal 2: Enable missions to efficiently deliver services to federal and contractor employees and resources.**

- 2.1 Establish and manage identities for all enterprise users and resources.
- 2.2 Design enterprise solutions to manage access to information and resources.
- 2.3 Use enterprise identity information discovery and enterprise centralized access management.
- 2.4 Leverage federated solutions to accept identity and authentication assertions made by other agency and mission partners when efficient.

**Goal 3: Provide enterprise-level solutions within agencies to improve operations and promote cost-effective and efficient use of resources.**

- 3.1 Streamline ICAM governance and program management within each agency to optimize execution, ensure consistency, and align intent across the enterprise.
- 3.2 Evaluate, rationalize, and migrate to modern, cloud-smart solutions for ICAM services.
- 3.3 Promote interoperability and efficiency across the federal government by buying and building ICAM solutions that use open, commercially adopted standards.

# Services Framework and Service Descriptions

The Services Framework is a tool designed for ICAM program managers and information technology enterprise architects. It identifies the services that provide functionality within the scope of ICAM and assists in distinguishing between business requirements and technical solutions. The services framework includes the five practice areas and services within.

## Practice Area Visual 

The graphic below illustrates the five ICAM practice areas and provides a list of services that fall within each area. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/services/services_overview.png" alt="Five boxes that each correspond to a FICAM practice area or supporting element. Each box lists the agency services that correspond to that area. You can find the services and definitions in the following pages.">

## Identity Management

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/services/services_identity_management.png" alt="An orange box with the list of Identity Management services defined later in the body text of this page."  width="314" height="400" align="right" style="padding-left:30px">

Identity Management is how an agency collects, verifies, manages attributes, and entitlements to establish and maintain enterprise identities for federal government employees, contractors, and authorized mission partners. This service does not apply to public or consumer identity management.

An enterprise identity record is the set of attributes or characteristics that describes a person within a given context:

- Your identity within your agency’s Human Resources (HR) system is different from your personal identity at your bank.
- A person’s identity as a government contractor is different from their identity as an Army Reservist.

Although your identity remains the same over time, it evolves as your attributes change, such as when you get a promotion, change your name, receive additional training, or retire.

Agencies should manage identity attributes as centrally as possible and distribute them as needed. Examples of identity attributes include:

- *Core identity attributes* - First name, last name, and address of record.
- *Contact attributes* - Physical location, government phone number, and government email address.
- *Authorization attributes* - Clearance, training, and job codes.

An entitlement is a specific type of authorization attribute that refers to an application permission. Entitlements management is the act of managing those permissions. An agency may group multiple entitlements into a specific role or group to streamline provision and de-provision activities as well as for auditing and reporting purposes. For example, a new employee may require access to ten core enterprise applications on the first day of work. An agency can create a new employee group with new employee entitlements and automate provisioning of the ten core applications rather than treat them as individual access requests.
Attributes and entitlements are created or aggregated through a number of manual and automated mechanisms. Mechanisms may include:

Attributes and entitlements are created or aggregated through a number of manual and automated mechanisms. Mechanisms may include: 

- Use a single sign-on tool to aggregate application access entitlements.
- Allow employees to update contact attributes in an employee record.
- Automate integration between a training system and an identity governance and administration tool to create and update annual security training.

Identity proofing is how an agency verifies an enterprise identity. The complexity of this process depends on the Identity Assurance Level (IAL) required for an identity. Federal agencies require a minimum IAL3 for employees and contractors. For example, a federal employee or contractor presents identity attributes via a driver’s license or utility bill. The agency verifies the identity documents and the individual’s photo (biometric).

An identifier is a unique attribute used to locate an identity in a system:

- While your agency may issue Personal Identification Verification (PIV) cards to multiple people named John Smith, each individual has a different PIV card number.
- While your agency may have more than one employee named Jane Smith, each employee has a unique email address tied only to their identity.

The Identity Management services in the Federal ICAM architecture include Creation, Identity Proofing, Provisioning, Maintenance, Identity Aggregation, and Deactivation. These services are sometimes collectively known as **Identity Lifecycle Management**.

| Service | Description | Keywords |
| --- | ------ | -----|
| Creation | Establish an identity made of attributes that define a person or entity. | Identity Record, Authoritative Source |
| Identity Proofing | Use identity attributes to connect a digital identity to a real-world entity. | Source Document Validation, Remote Proofing, In-Person Proofing|
| Provisioning | Create, manage, and delete accounts and entitlements. | Identity Lifecycle Management, Workflow, Deprovisioning, Account Management, Account Creation, Entitlements Management |
| Maintenance | Maintain accurate and current attributes in an identity record over its lifecycle. | Identity Lifecycle Management, Updating, Attribute Management |
| Identity Aggregation | Find and connect disparate identity records for the same person or entity. | Identity Reconciliation, Identity Resolution, Account Linking|
| Deactivation | Deactivate or remove enterprise identity records. | Identity Lifecycle Management, Suspension, Archiving, Deletion |

## Credential Management

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/services/services_cred_management.png" alt="A green box with the list of Credential Management services defined later in the body text of this page." width="314" height="400" align="right" style="padding-left:30px">

Credential Management is how an agency issues, manages, and revokes credentials bound to enterprise identities.

A credential is a data structure that authoritatively binds an authenticator to an existing identity using one or more identifiers.

Types of authenticators include:

- Something you know, like a password or PIN.
- Something you have, like a private key or One-Time Password (OTP) generator.
- Something you are, like a fingerprint or an iris.

The Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) determines the authenticators associated with a credential. Federal government-wide policy requires a minimum AAL2 for employees and contractors.

Examples of credentials include:

- An agency-issued smart card, such as a PIV or Common Access Card (CAC), that includes a picture and cryptographic key pairs to assert your identity at a federal facility.
- A combination of credentials, such as a username/password with an OTP generated by a mobile application, to assert your identity to a federal web application.

Unlike identities, credentials can expire. If an enterprise identity continues past a credential’s expiration date, the issuing agency can issue a new credential.

The Credential Management services in the FICAM architecture include Sponsorship, Registration, Generation & Issuance, Maintenance, and Revocation.

| Service | Description | Keywords |
| --- | ------ | -----|
| Sponsorship | Formally establish that a person or entity requires a credential. | Sponsor, Authorizing Official, Affiliation, Request |
| Registration | Collect the information needed from a person or entity to issue them a credential. | Enrollment |
| Generation & Issuance | Assign a credential to a person or entity. | Activation, Token, Authenticator |
| Maintenance | Maintain a credential throughout its lifecycle. | Renewal, Reset, Suspension, Reissuance |
| Revocation | Revoke a credential from a person or entity, or deactivate an authenticator. | Termination |

## Access Management

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/services/services_access_management.png" alt="A blue box with the list of Access Management services defined later in the body text of this page." width="314" height="400" align="right" style="padding-left:30px">

Access Management is how an agency authenticates enterprise identities and authorizes appropriate access to protected services.

Policy administration is a combination of laws, regulations, rules, and agency policies that secures access to agency services. Your agency determines the requirements for an individual to access each resource category; they can be as simple or as complex as needed.

Examples of access requirements include:

- “Grant access to anyone on this list of people.”
- “Grant access to any agency employee or contractor with an authenticated PIV card.”
- “Grant access to anyone who is a federal employee, GS-12 or higher, cleared Top Secret, trained in first aid, and certified as a project manager.”

In providing access services, it can be challenging to conduct an application discovery and inventory for both physical and logical access. For logical access, see the [Application Inventory and Identity Risk Analysis section of the Enterprise Single Sign-On Playbook.]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/sso/#step-2-plan-application-integration){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

### Authentication

Authentication is how you verify the claimed identity of someone trying to access an agency resource. Typically, you’ll verify an identity using an authenticator associated with a credential. To determine the appropriate authenticator level, use the [Digital Identity Risk Assessment Playbook]({{site.baseurl}}/playbooks/dira/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Authentication is generally a two-step process:

> *Step 1.*  Authenticate the credential:

- Did a trusted organization issue the credential?
- Has the credential expired?
- Has the credential been revoked, voided, or tampered with?

> *Step 2.* Ensure the individual to whom the credential was issued is the same individual presenting it:

- Do the photo and attributes on the credential match the person who presented it?
- Does the person know the PIN for the credential?
- Does the person have the private key on the smart card for the certificate presented to a website?

### Authorization

Authorization is how you decide whether you should allow someone to access an agency resource. Access requirements usually dictate whether you’ll allow someone to:

- Read or modify a certain document.
- Access an agency website.
- Enter an agency facility or location.

Usually, authorization occurs immediately after authentication. When you log in to a service, you present your credentials. The service then confirms that your credentials are valid (authentication) and grants or denies you access based on your assigned permissions (authorization).

Authorizations are based on progressive, fine-grained access models. Most agencies implement role-based access and move toward more fine-grained access such as attribute-based or risk adaptive access control, as outlined in the [Federal Zero Trust Strategy](https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}. While there are defined access models, vendors may implement them in different or overlapping ways. Ensure your agency develops use cases and understands how a vendor meets the use case.

| | Less Fine-Grained | --> | --> | More Fine-Grained |
| |:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Access Model | Access Control Lists (ACLs) | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)| Risk Adaptive Access Control (RAAC) |
| Description | A static list of entities with their access rights. | Access based on a user's static pre-defined role. | Access based on a user's assigned attributes which may be static or dynamic. | Access based on dynamic risk factors. |
| Example | Allow Jane Doe access to email application | Jane Doe is assigned the user role "New Employee" which grants access to email and sharepoint. | Allow Jane Doe to access email if on a government device (device attribute) and in the United States (location attribute). | If Jane Doe is in assigned work location, allow email access from any managed device. If Jane Doe is not in assigned work location, only allow email access from a government device. |

Each authorization model has benefits and limitations. The policies and access requirements defined by agency business owners help define the model that best suits their needs. More robust access control models, such as ABAC, can help agencies with improved automation, and they are increasingly adopted by cloud-native and cloud-friendly services.

The Access Management services in the FICAM architecture include Policy Administration, Authentication, Authorization, and Privileged Access Management.

| Service | Description | Keywords |
| --- | ------ | -----|
| Digital Policy Administration | Create and maintain the technical access requirements that govern access to protected agency services. | Policy Decision, Policy Enforcement | 
| Authentication | Verify that a claimed identity is genuine based on valid credentials. | Validation, Two-Factor, Multi-Factor |
| Authorization | Grant or deny access requests to protected agency services based on access requirements, identity attributes, and entitlements. | Policy Decision, Policy Enforcement | 
| Privileged Access Management | Protect access to accounts that have access permissions that can affect IT system configurations and data security (e.g., superusers, domain administrators, or global administrators). | Privileged Identity Management, Privileged Account Management, Administration, Superuser |

## Federation

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/services/services_federation.png" alt="A gray box with the list of Federation services defined later in the body text of this page." width="314" height="400" align="right" style="padding-left:30px">

Federation is the technology, policies, standards, and processes that allow an agency to accept digital identities, attributes, and credentials managed by other agencies.

Federation has many different applications, including:

- *Accepting an authentication transaction from another organization:*

> Agency A authenticates one of its users and passes identity attributes and transaction details to Agency B. Agency B grants access to an application for that identity.

- *Accepting specific characteristics (i.e., attributes such as identifiers) describing an individual from another organization:*

> An individual can use their agency-issued credential containing an internal identifier(s) to directly log in to a different agency’s online service. The online service registers the identifier(s) in its system for future use.

The Federation services in the FICAM architecture include Policy Alignment, Authentication Broker, and Attribute Exchange.

| Service | Description | Keywords |

## Governance

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/services/services_governance.png" alt="A navy box with the list of Governance services defined later in the body text of this page." width="314" height="400" align="right" style="padding-left:30px">

Governance is the set of practices and systems that guides ICAM functions, activities, and outcomes.

To perform effective governance, agencies must collect data about ICAM functions from many sources, such as policies and entitlements stores, and analyze this data. Proper data analytics help agencies monitor compliance with established information security policies.

If your agency identifies problems during data collection and analysis, you should remediate these issues as quickly as possible. Real-time monitoring and risk mitigation are crucial to ensure employees and contractors have only the appropriate access, following the principle of least privilege.

The Governance services in the FICAM architecture include Identity Governance, Analytics, and Mitigation.

| Service | Description | Keywords |
| --- | ------ | -----|
| Identity Governance | The systems, solutions, and rules that link enterprise personnel, applications, and data to help agencies manage access and risk. | Management Framework, Rules and Procedures, Access Reviews and Recertifications | 
| Analytics | Leverage continuous analytics data to identify if someone has entitlements that conflict with access requirements. | Data collection, Monitoring, Review, Data Certification, Auditing and Reporting | 
| Mitigation | Correct the problems and address risks, discovered by analysis, that may occur during standard operations. | Redress, Remediation |

# Use Cases

These use cases are designed for ICAM Enterprise Architects and business owners and describe some of the most common ICAM business processes.

Each use case includes a high-level summary of the scenario, individuals and systems involved in the use case, illustrations that show the required steps to achieve the end goal, and an icon that indicates the practice area and the service with which the use case most closely aligns.

For details about ICAM services, see the [Services Framework](#services-framework-and-service-descriptions).

While each use case describes a particular ICAM business process, the use cases are all interrelated. The use cases generalize the activities and technologies to make sure they apply across many agencies.

You can combine or build upon the ICAM use cases to support your agency’s scenarios and needs.

        <p>Before you can create a credential and assign it to an individual, that person must provide proof of their claimed identity. Identity proofing is the process by which a federal agency collects and verifies information about a person to establish an enterprise identity.</p>
        <p>The location or information that a person needs to access informs the Identity Assurance Level (IAL), which determines the elements you should require from that person for identity proofing. There are three IALs; however, federal agencies require a minimum of IAL2 for employees or contractors with recurring access to government resources, so these use cases do not include IAL1.</p>
        <p>This use case describes the high-level steps to proof an identity at IAL2 or IAL3. Depending on the required IAL, you may require increasingly more information from an employee or contractor or partner along with additional verification steps. The information provided by the employee or contractor is also known as identity evidence. Identity evidence may be physical, such as passports, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>IAL2</strong> - first and last name, email address, and address of record, supported by appropriate identity documentation and verified as strong.</li>

# Reference Example

This reference example include sample enterprise ICAM tools (e.g., solutions, applications, and software) aligned with ICAM service areas that illustrate ICAM functionality at an agency. The reference examples are designed for enterprise architects, security engineers, and solution architects to facilitate discussions regarding the technology solutions to integrate with enterprise applications and the business requirements.

The system's components are representative examples only. Some solutions chosen by your agency may span across more than one service area.

The following figure is an example for a small selection of system components only. You can modify the graphic or incorporate it as is and target state system components for enterprise roadmap planning.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/arch/ComponentExamples.png" alt="A diagram that shows example components for each service area, and relationships between practice areas." width="560" height="319">

## Authoritative Sources
An authoritative source is a trusted repository of identity attribute data.  It’s possible to have multiple authoritative sources for attributes.

Authoritative sources systems components may include:

- Human Resource systems such as payroll, time and attendance, and benefits administration
- Agency or government-wide Learning Management Systems
- Agency or government-wide Personnel Security systems for security and suitability
- Directory services, including on-premise or cloud-based directory services
- Other external or internal sources

## Identity Management Systems
Identity management systems are how an agency manages the identity lifecycle. 

Identity management system components may include:

- Identity Governance and Administration tool for provisioning and workflow 
- Role management or role manager applications
- Identity correlation or aggregation
- Directory management
- Virtual directories

## Credential Management Systems
Credential management systems are how an agency manages an authentication token bound to an identity.

Credential management system components may include:

- PIV credential service provider solutions
- Other non-PKI credential service provider solutions 
- Federated certification authorities
- Private certification authorities
- Key management services 
- Enterprise certificate manager
- Multi-factor authentication managers for software and hardware tokens
