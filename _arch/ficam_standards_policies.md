> _Temporary_.  This memorandum directs that agencies utilize technology to the greatest extent practicable to support mission continuity during the national emergency. By aggressively embracing technology to support business processes, the Federal Government is better positioned to maintain the safety and well-being of the Federal workforce and the American public while supporting the continued delivery of vital mission services. The set of _frequently asked questions_ are intended to provide additional guidance and further assist the IT workforce as it addresses impacts.

> This memorandum sets forth the Federal Government’s ICAM policy. To ensure secure and efficient operations, agencies of the Federal Government must be able to identify, credential, monitor, and manage subjects that access Federal resources. This includes information, information systems, facilities, and secured areas across their respective enterprises. In particular, how agencies conduct identity proofing, establish enterprise digital identities, and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control significantly affects the security and delivery of their services, as well as individuals’ privacy.

<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/M-19-03.pdf" target="_blank">**M-19-03: Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies by enhancing the High Value Asset (HVA) Program**</a> (PDF, December 2018)<br/>
> With the creation of the HVA initiative in 2015, the Federal Government’s CFO Act agencies took a pivotal step toward the identification of its most critical assets. DHS, in coordination with OMB, established a capability to assess agency HVAs, resulting in the identification of critical areas of weakness and plans to remediate those areas of weakness. It established three possible categories for designating Federal information or a Federal information system as an HVA: Informational Value, Mission Essential, or Federal Civilian Enterprise Essential (FCEE). It also updates the required approach for agencies to report, assess, and remediate HVAs to protect against cyberattacks.

> Information and IT resources are critical to the U.S. social, political, and economic well-being. They enable the Federal Government to provide quality services to citizens, generate and disseminate knowledge, and facilitate greater productivity and advancement as a Nation. It is important for the Federal Government to maximize the quality and security of federal information systems, and to develop and implement uniform and consistent information resources management policies in order to inform the public and improve the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of agency programs. Additionally, as technology evolves, it is important that agencies manage information systems in a way that addresses and mitigates security and privacy risks associated with new IT resources and new information processing capabilities.

## Standards

<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63/3/final" target="_blank">**NIST SP 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines**</a> (June 2017)<br/>
> Agencies use these guidelines as part of the risk assessment and implementation of their digital service(s). These guidelines provide mitigations for an authentication error’s negative impacts by separating the individual elements of identity assurance into its component parts. 

<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63a/final" target="_blank">**NIST SP 800-63A: Digital Identity Guidelines - Enrollment and Identity Proofing**</a> (PDF, June 2017)<br/>
> This guideline focuses on the enrollment and verification of an identity for use in digital services. Central to this is a process known as identity proofing in which an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP) reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the CSP to assert that identification at an Identity Assurance Level (IAL). This document defines technical requirements for each of three IALs.

<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63b/final" target="_blank">**NIST SP 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines - Authentication and Lifecycle Management**</a> (PDF, June 2017)<br/>
> These guidelines focus on the authentication of subjects interacting with government systems over open networks, establishing that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing the authentication or may be asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system. This document defines technical requirements for each of the three Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs). 

<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63c/final" target="_blank">**NIST SP 800-63C: Digital Identity Guidelines - Federation and Assertions**</a> (PDF, June 2017)<br/>
> These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the use of federated identity and the use of assertions to implement identity federations. Federation allows a given CSP to provide authentication and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number of separately-administered relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use more than one CSP.

<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-162/final" target="_blank">**NIST SP 800-162: Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations**</a> (PDF, January 2014)<br/>
> This guideline provides federal agencies with a definition of ABAC.

> This guideline provides federal agencies with information for implementing attributes in access control systems. Attributes enable a logical access control methodology where authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given set of attributes. This document outlines factors which influence attributes that an authoritative body must address when standardizing an attribute system and proposes some notional implementation suggestions for consideration.

> This guideline contains technical specifications for biometric data mandated in FIPS. These specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and performance of the PIV credential. This specification addresses image acquisition to support the background check, fingerprint template creation, retention, and authentication. The biometric data specification in this document is the mandatory format for biometric data carried in the PIV Data Model (SP 800-73-1, Appendix A). Biometric data used only outside the PIV Data Model is not within the scope of this standard.

<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-122/final" target="_blank">**NIST SP 800-122: Guide for Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**</a> (PDF. April 2010)<br/>

This document provides practical, context-based guidance for identifying PII and determining what level of protection is appropriate for each instance of PII. The document also suggests safeguards that may offer appropriate levels of protection for PII and provides recommendations for developing response plans for breaches involving PII.
