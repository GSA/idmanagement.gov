The Services Framework identifies the services that provide functionality within the scope of ICAM. The Services Framework is a tool for you to help translate between business requirements and technical solutions.

The Services Framework is designed for ICAM program managers and information technology enterprise architects.

These pages describe the services that support each ICAM practice area and supporting element, with descriptions and simple graphics for you to use:

* [Identity Management]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}identity)
* [Credential Management]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}credentials)
* [Access Management]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}access)
* [Federation]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}federation)
* [Governance]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}governance)
