You can assign access entitlements to individuals, roles, and groups. These entitlements define an employee or contractor’s access to agency services, so you’ll need to assign entitlements before an employee or contractor can access an agency service.

## Use Case

In this use case, an administrator needs to assign entitlements to an employee or contractor.

    <td style="border:0px;"> The administrator assigns the entitlements to the employee or contractor.<br><br>Any time the employee or contractor’s role or relationship changes, the administrator updates the entitlements accordingly, including removing entitlements as needed.</td>

## Examples

- I want to indicate that an employee or contractor requires and is allowed access to an agency service, so that they can access the service when needed.
- An employee is hired to be part of the financial review team and requires access to financial applications. The employee has a role assigned to their enterprise identity record, and associated with their identity attributes.
