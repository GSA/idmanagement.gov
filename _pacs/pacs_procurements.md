This page provides a sample PACS Procurement Checklist. You can reuse or tailor this checklist according to your agency’s practices. The checklist highlights common procurement activities as they relate to the following roles:
- Information Technology or Physical Security Engineers (ENG)
- Project Managers (PM)
- Procurement Officers (PO)
- Chief Information Officers (CIO)
- Chief Security Officers (CSO)

Agency staff are encouraged to participate in steps where their roles are listed in blue, bold font.

	<li>The sample survey questions below will help you assess the FSL of each facility and select the right PIV authentication mechanisms:
	<ul>
		<li>Who will use a facility’s PACS? Include all possible users.</li>
		<li>What credentials do the facility’s users and visitors have?</li>
		<li>What facility access risks exist?</li>
		<li>How can the facility mitigate these risks?</li>
		<li>What PACS installations does the facility need?</li>
		<li>What support systems would be integrated into the facility’s PACS (for example, intrusion detection, video surveillance, emergency notification, elevator control)?</li>
		<li>What PACS integrator or other contractor services does the agency need to solicit bids on?</li>
		<li>What PACS hardware and software is needed?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Your agency’s selected integrator will help select the approved, needed hardware and software through the GSA Acquisitions process (Schedules 70 and 84, Blanket Purchase Orders, etc.). The following are some useful considerations:
	<ul>
		<li>What are the facility’s common ingress and egress traffic patterns?</li>
		<li>What throughput speeds are needed?</li>
		<li>What are the ongoing operational and projected maintenance needs?</li>
		<li>What are the training needs for PACS administrators, operators, technicians, and users?</li>
		<li>Which PIV authentication mechanism(s) will be needed to secure the facility?</li>

## Why Can We Buy Only GSA-Approved Products and Services?
[GSA’s FIPS 201 Evaluation Program](https://www.idmanagement.gov/fips201/){:target="_blank"} tests all GSA-listed PACS products, topologies, and services for compliance with FIPS 201-2 requirements. Purchasing products listed on the GSA APL ensures product compliance with FIPS 201-2, secure operations, and interoperability.
