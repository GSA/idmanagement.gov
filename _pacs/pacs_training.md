## Technical Roles and Responsibilities

PACS project teams consist of both agency employees and contractors. Teams include an IT Architect, Engineers, Technicians, Operators, System Administrators, Physical Security Specialists, Facility Managers, a variety of technical services team members, etc. The table below describes the most common PACS technical roles: 

| Technical Role | Responsibilities |
|:------|:-------------| 
| IT Architect | Defines the project's technical activities according to the project scope and requirements; conducts further analysis and design, as required; and directs the implementation of a PACS solution. |
| Engineer | Makes configuration recommendations and advises the IT Architect about enterprise-wide network improvements, PACS hardware and software optimization, testing, deployment, and maintenance.|
| Technician | Installs, administers, and maintains network and system components. |
| Operator | Uses physical security functions, such as setting access privileges or taking actions to resolve system-generated events and alarms.|

## Recommended Technical Training

| Role | Recommended Training |
|:------|:-------------| 
| IT Architects| Must be knowledgeable about the [GSA PACS APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the manufacturers' solutions for PACS. Should be knowledgeable about Federal Government and agency-specific policies, standards, and guidance documents to make design recommendations related to a PACS implementation. Architects must possess a current [Certified System Engineer ICAM PACS (CSEIP) certification](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} or other similar, federally recognized certification in order to implement a PACS solution.|
| Engineers| May hold a [CSEIP](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} certification or other similar, federally recognized certification. Engineers may optionally complete PACS products' manufacturers' training (for example, PACS APL products) related to the PACS implementation. Should be knowledgeable about Federal Government and agency-specific policies, standards, and guidance documents related to enterprise networks and an PACS implementation. |
| Technicians | Should complete PACS products' manufacturers' training (i.e., PACS APL products) related to the PACS solution implementation.| 
| Operators | Should complete tailored training in Federal Government policies and standards related to PACS. Completing PACS products' manufacturers' (i.e., PACS APL products) certification related to the PACS implementation is recommended.|

## Training Opportunities

{% include alert-info.html content="Agencies that plan to initiate a PACS Project should include line items for related employee training in their annual training plans and annual training budgets." %}

### Department of Homeland Security - Interagency Security Committee
The [Interagency Security Committee](https://www.dhs.gov/interagency-security-committee){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} developed a series of free, self-paced, [online training courses](https://www.dhs.gov/interagency-security-committee-training){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} that provide an overview of facility security standards, processes, and practices.

### Equipment Manufacturers
[GSA PACS APL](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} PACS manufacturers whose products are listed on the GSA PACS APL offer product-specific courses for Operators and Technicians directly or through authorized service providers. Operators and Technicians may obtain certifications for completing some series of courses.

>**Note:** Manufacturer training may not address unique operational requirements or site-specific configurations, so authorized service providers should conduct this training:  [GSA Schedule 84](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/list-of-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and/or [GSA Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

### Authorized Service Providers
Authorized service providers offer manufacturer training for installing, configuring, and maintaining PACSs: [GSA Schedule 84](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/list-of-gsa-schedules/schedule-84security-fire-law-enforcement){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [GSA Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. This training can be tailored to your agency, facility, implementation features, operational policies, and procedures. This training should be planned during the Procurements phase. 

### Industry Certifications
Industry certifications are vendor-neutral and standards-based. GSA requires that all work performed on approved PACS for GSA-managed facilities must be designed and installed by a Certified System Engineer for ICAM PACS (CSEIP).  The [CSEIP Program](https://www.securetechalliance.org/activities-certified-system-engineer-icam-pacs-training-and-certification-program/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} trains those who implement solutions related to OMB M-05-24 and OMB M-19-17.

Additional certification opportunities are offered by commercial vendors.

### GSA PACS Reverse Industry Day Conference (2018)

In 2018, GSA hosted a _PACS Reverse Industry Day_ conference that featured government and industry experts on a range of PACS topics. Event videos are available via the GSA YouTube channel:
