Version 1.0  
August xx, 2023

The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) 2 Community of Action (CoA), along with the Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Subcommittee Phishing-Resistant Authenticator Working Group, developed this playbook to help agencies understand phishing-resistant authentication and plan a phishing-resistant alternative authenticator pilot.

# Executive Summary

The identity pillar of the Federal Zero Trust Strategy outlines new methods to reduce system vulnerabilities by implementing phishing–resistant authenticators. Agencies have widely implemented the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential for physical and logical authentication. Still, a PIV credential and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) it relies on comes with procedural and operational challenges that hinder its ability to be comprehensively relied on for logical authentication, especially with newer commercial technologies and for remote and field personnel. Due to this, many applications are protected by only a password or other weak, phishable multi-factor authentication (MFA) forms. While agencies must continue to follow the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) credentialing policy, agencies are not required to use PIV for logical authentication. There are modern phishing-resistant authentication options agencies can deploy alongside PIV. 

This playbook includes an educational 101 section but also a three-step process to help agencies identify use cases, technical solutions, and an outline of a FIDO2 pilot plan based on experience from the FIDO2 CoA and content developed by the ICAM Subcommittee Phishing-Resistant Authenticator Working Group. The three-step pilot process includes the following:

1.	Recognize common authentication patterns and use cases to scope a pilot.
2.	Identify available solutions or acquisition strategies.
3.	Deploy a pilot using the FIDO2 CoA six-part pilot plan.

    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Pursue Greater use of Passwordless Multi-factor Authentication</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      When a PIV credential is impractical, the Federal Zero Trust Strategy (OMB Memo 22-09) permits agencies to use alternative authenticators that support the FIDO2 and Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specifications. The Strategy also encourages agencies to pursue greater use of passwordless and phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

While moving to a zero trust architecture can be a multi-year journey, many agencies that use modern platforms or FedRAMP access management tools have reduced their password usage through a FIDO2 pilot in only a couple of weeks to months. This playbook is a tool designed to assist agency ICAM program managers and enterprise and application architects in reducing or altogether removing passwords at their agency or within applications, as well as replacing legacy MFA products such as those based on one-time password (OTP) or push-notification technologies that are vulnerable to phishing attacks. While using this playbook is optional, implementing phishing-resistant authenticators for your workforce is required. Agencies are encouraged to tailor this playbook to fit their unique organizational structure, mission needs, and requirements. Other IT program participants, including program managers and application teams, may find value in incorporating this playbook in their planning.

## Audience

This playbook is designed for agency ICAM program managers and enterprise and application architects interested in reducing or completely removing passwords in their agency or applications. Other IT program participants, including program managers and application teams, may find value in incorporating this playbook approach in their planning.

## Disclaimer

The FIDO2 CoA developed this playbook, along with content developed by the Phishing-Resistant Authenticator Working Group of the ICAM Subcommittee. U.S. Federal Executive Branch agencies can use this playbook to plan and integrate phishing-resistant authenticators into their agency ICAM processes. This playbook is not an official policy, mandates agency action, nor does it provide authoritative information technology terms. It includes best practices to supplement existing federal policies and builds upon Office of Management and Budget Memorandum 22-09 and existing FICAM guidance and playbooks. Subject areas with intersecting scopes, such as identity proofing, lifecycle management, authenticator binding, credentialing standards, and authenticator assurance levels, are considered only to the extent they relate to identifying and implementing phishing-resistant authentication. Privileged access management (e.g., superusers, domain administrators) is out of the scope of this playbook.

# Phishing-Resistance 101

While network attacks have become more complex, phishing remains one of the main tactics used to compromise credentials and infiltrate networks to move laterally and compromise data. In recent years attackers have moved beyond phishing passwords from users to phishing OTP codes and push notifications that have been used to add a second factor to protect accounts.  As CISA has noted, “Cyber threat actors have used multiple methods to gain access to MFA credentials,” using tactics such as:
- **Phishing** is a form of social engineering in which cyber threat actors use email or malicious websites to solicit information. For example, in a widely used phishing technique, a threat actor sends an email to a target that convinces the user to visit a threat actor-controlled website that mimics a company’s legitimate login portal. The user submits their password and the 6-digit code from their mobile phone’s authenticator app. 
- **Push bombing** (also known as push fatigue) is where cyber threat actors bombard users with push notifications until they press the “Accept” button, granting threat actors access to the network. 
- **The exploitation of SS7 protocol vulnerabilities** is where cyber threat actors exploit SS7 protocol vulnerabilities in communications infrastructure to obtain MFA codes sent via text message or voice to a phone. 
- **SIM Swap** is a form of social engineering in which cyber threat actors convince cellular carriers to transfer control of the user’s phone number to a threat actor-controlled SIM card, which allows the threat actor to gain control over the user’s phone.

Even though a PIV credential is the primary authentication method for federal users and is phishing-resistant, many agencies rely on passwords, OTP, or push-based MFA when a user does not have a PIV credential. Agencies must focus on replacing these susceptible authenticators with phishing-resistant methods.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--success">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <p class="usa-alert__text">Phishing-resistant authentication refers to authentication processes designed to detect and prevent disclosure of authentication secrets and outputs to a website or application masquerading as a legitimate system.</p>
  </div>
</div>

The requirement for phishing-resistant methods is outlined in OMB Memo 22-09, the Federal Zero Trust Strategy. While agencies may continue to deploy PIV and Derived PIV credentials to meet this requirement, the underlying technology behind PIV credentials, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and smart cards (like the PIV and PIV-Interoperable credential) have specific challenges that limit their use with all users and on all systems. These challenges include:
1.	**Device limitations with physical card readers** – Card readers are optimized for desktops or laptops, but more and more federal workforce use mobile devices. Derived PIV solutions may sometimes fill the gap but also present cost and complexity challenges.
2.	**PIV credential issuance requirements and supply chain disruptions** - A PIV credential recipient must physically go to an issuance station; not all recipients live within a 50-mile radius. The average time to receive a PIV credential is two weeks from when it is ready to be issued. This can be further delayed by acquisition and scheduling delays or global supply chain availability of processors.
3.	**Ineligible PIV population** - A PIV credential is only issued to individuals needing physical and logical access beyond six months.
4.	**PKI validation software compromise or availability** - As experienced over the summer of 2023, an outage in validation software can break the availability of PKI-based credentials such as PIV and Derived PIV. Agencies must identify and deploy phishing-resistant alternatives when a PIV credential is unavailable.
5.	**Modern technology doesn’t support PKI** - This challenge is decreasing as more software providers natively support PKI through native certificate-based authentication.

To this point, separate access management systems or exception policies that often rely on passwords or other weak authentication are the typical agency approach to handle users and systems that can't use PKI or users without a PIV credential. Both approaches add cost and complexity and introduce manual processes, potentially risking an agency's mission or data. OMB Memo 22-09 details that agencies use other phishing-resistant authenticators such as FIDO2. Additionally, agencies are encouraged to use passwordless MFA, such as authentication solutions that eliminate knowledge factors like passwords and instead rely on a possession factor that is unlocked using a biometric or PIN.

Figure 1. Types of Passwordless MFA
 <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/playbooks/pra-1-passwordless.png" align="center" alt="Multifactor Authentication includes using two different factors; something you have like a phone or laptop, something you are like a fingerprint or face recognition, or something you know like a password or security question answer. Passwordless can either be an MFA that doesn't use a password, or that doesn't use a knowledge factor.">

Some agencies are deploying FIDO2 solutions leveraging a laptop TPM and biometric to replace usernames and passwords to improve the user login and authentication experience. More lessons learned from the FIDO2 Community of Action can be found below.

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as passwords, PINs, and OTPs or bank account credentials, through fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. It’s not the only way an attacker can access a system. Six MITRE ATT&CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) are commonly used for credential-based attacks.

Figure 2. MITRE ATT&CK TTPs for Phishing and Credential-based attacks.
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/playbooks/pra-2-mitre.png" align="center" alt="Most alternative authenticators used today such as username and password, one time pin, or push notifications are susceptible to common attacks such as phishing, compromised accounts, adversary in the middle, brute force, MFA interception, or MFA fatigue. Hardware keys like PKI or FIDO are less prone to these types of attacks.">

### Reconnaissance Phase TTP

-	[Phishing (T1566)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} - Phishing most likely are authentic-looking emails with a sense of purpose or urgency to click on a link or share information. Links can lead to fraudulent websites that either harvest credentials or deliver malware.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--warning">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Does using phishing-resistant authentication really resist phishing?</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      Phishing-resistant authentication prevents phishing attacks that target the authentication process – in other words, stealing credentials. Some types of phishing campaigns attempt to convince the victim to open malware (e.g. an email attachment), which is not an attack on authentication and thus not prevented by phishing-resistant authentication.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Initial Access TTP

-	[Adversary-in-The-Middle (AiTM) (T1557)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} – Adversaries position a network device to intercept communications which can include network sniffing or credential compromise.
-	[Breach Corpus (T1586)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} – It is very common for a user to leverage the same password across multiple sites, especially when a password manager either isn’t used or supported. A breach corpus is a data set of compromised usernames and passwords that can further be used in a credential access tactic.

### Credential Access TTP

-	[Brute Force (T1110)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} - Guessing style attack using a breach corpus of compromised passwords or a new data set.
-	[MFA Interception (T1111)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} – Adversaries may target MFA mechanisms (i.e. smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. This is often associated with SIM stealing for phone-based OTP, keylogging to intercept smart card PINs, or other efforts to trick a user into typing their MFA code into a phishing site.
-	[MFA Fatigue (T1621)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} – Adversaries may abuse the generation of push notifications to repeat login attempts continuously. This bombards the user with login requests until they potentially give in.

## What is Phishing-Resistance?

Previous sections identified how credentials are susceptible to phishing and other attack types; this section identifies which types of MFA are phishing-resistant. Not all types of MFA are created equal, with some stronger than others. Phishing-resistant authentication is designed to prevent the disclosure of authentication secrets and outputs to a website or application masquerading as a legitimate system. The two leading phishing-resistant authenticators agencies deploy include PKI (PIV-based, PIV-I, or Only Locally Trusted) and FIDO2 authenticators. Note that FIDO2 is sometimes described as WebAuthn authenticators. WebAuthn is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard in FIDO2.

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

These phishing-resistant authenticator types aren’t susceptible to phishing because both leverage public key cryptography technology, which creates a public and private key pair. 
-	The private key is stored on a device, making it extremely hard to compromise. In the case of PIV credentials or FIDO2 Roaming Authenticators, the private key is never shared or exported.
-	The public key is shared with people or things like websites.

NIST Special Publication on Digital Identity Guidelines includes a list of requirements to meet their definition of phishing-resistant, otherwise known as verifier impersonation-resistant. **Any authenticator that involves the manual entry of an authenticator output, such as a one-time PIN or other knowledge factor, is not considered phishing-resistant**. Due to this design, an authenticator leveraging public key cryptography is more resilient to phishing and credential attacks. There are some unique considerations between PKI and FIDO2.

      A credential is an authenticator but also validates the person to the authenticator. A passport, driver's license, or PIV are examples of a credential, but they may also be a diploma or certificate. An authenticator doesn’t have the validation part. For example, a password without a username is an example of an authenticator. You don’t know who it belongs to, but someone can use it to authenticate something.

## What is FIDO?

This section provides a high-level overview of the FIDO Alliance and what they provide. The FIDO Alliance is a non-profit industry association of technology vendors publishing MFA specifications and testing and certifying vendor products against those specifications. For a technical summary of FIDO2, see the [CISA Secure Cloud BUsiness Applications (SCuBA) Hybrid Identity Solutions Architecture](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/csso-scuba-guidance_document-hybrid_identity_solutions_architecture-2023.03.22-final.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}. FIDO2 is a FIDO specification and a WC3 standard.

1. FIDO Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) -  A simple protocol for communication between a roaming authenticator (such as a FIDO security key) and another client or platform over USB, Near Field Communication (NFC), or Bluetooth (BT). CTAP is a newer version of what was formerly called Universal Second Factor (U2F).
2. W3C WebAuthn - A W3C standard for javascript Application Programming Interfaces (API) to allow servers to authenticate users through FIDO2 authentication in browsers and devices. WebAuthn enables web services to support various FIDO2 authenticator form factors easily.

Figure 3. Example of a FIDO2 Authentication Transaction
 <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/playbooks/pra-3-example.png" align="center" alt="An authenticator uses CTAP to talk to a client or platform. The client or platform then use Web Authentication to register to authenticate to a Relying Party. Both transactions are encrypted between the authenticator and the device and from the device to the relying party.">

A FIDO transaction for registration and authentication includes four main steps for each.

1. **Enroll a FIDO authenticator** with a new online service.
   1. For services supporting a FIDO authenticator, the user is prompted to select an available FIDO option (usually available for a phone or tablet or a security key). The online service establishes the list of acceptable authenticator options.
   2. The user unlocks the FIDO authenticator (a separate process from unlocking the device) using a biometric, a PIN, or tapping the device. This unlocks the device to create a new key pair. Any biometric capture or use is on the local device and not shared according to the FIDO specification.
   3. The user's device creates a new public/private key pair unique to the local device, the online service, and the user's account identifier. **A unique key pair is created per online service**.
   4. The public key is sent to the online service to register the user and device to the user's account in the online service.
2. **Login using a FIDO authenticator** process.
   1. The user navigates to the online service and is prompted for the FIDO authenticator.
   2. The online service sends a challenge-response request. The user selects the FIDO option used to register with the service. They unlock the FIDO authenticator following the method used for enrollment.
   3. The device selects the appropriate user account identifier and key to sign a challenge-response request to the online service.
   4. The device sends the signed challenge back to the online service, which verifies the signature with the user's stored public key.
 
A FIDO authenticator comes in two main types.
1.	Platform authenticator - Delivered via a secure, isolated execution environment (such as a TPM chip, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or Secure Enclave (SE) chip built into devices. One example includes Windows Hello for Business.
2.	Roaming authenticator - Colloquially called a security key, a USB-A or C-based physical device that can be used wirelessly across devices over NFC and BT. Some examples include Yubico's Yubikey, Identiv's UTrust, RSA's DS-100, and others. If a PIV credential were also FIDO-certified, it would be categorized as a roaming authenticator.

You may hear FIDO authentication referred to as a “passkey.”  This is a new term that many companies are using to describe passwordless FIDO experiences; consumers are being urged to create a passkey instead of a password for improved security and user experience.  Behind the scenes, a passkey is a FIDO-generated key pair, but the private key may be synced across a user’s devices for increased usability.  Syncable passkeys, otherwise called discoverable credentials in the FIDO specification, are well suited for most consumer/public-facing use cases, but there are some aspects of using syncable keys in enterprise applications that are still evolving, and this paper does not recommend their use in the enterprise at this time. For more information on passkeys, see this [FIDO Alliance white paper](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} and [Auth0 blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-passkeys/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}.

Since FIDO2 leverages public key cryptography and is hardware-based, it is categorized as a **single-factor or multi-factor cryptographic device** authenticator type in NIST Special Publication 800-63. It could achieve Authenticator Assurance Level 2 or 3. The specific level depends on multiple criteria, with the authenticator type as just one piece of an authentication transaction.

    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">A Case Study on Authenticator Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      Agencies need a plan or approved alternative when a user doesn't have a PIV credential or if the PIV validation infrastructure is compromised or unavailable. In May 2022, Microsoft released a patch that changed how PKI certificates (including PIV credential certificates) are mapped in Active Directory. These changes broke certificate-based authentication for many agencies that mapped PKI certificates using the User Principal Name (usually an email address). This patch also caught a lot of agencies off guard as they saw rolling outages as Domain Controllers updated. For agencies that only relied on PIV credentials, this was a dire risk management decision to apply an agency–wide username/password exception or run vulnerable servers. CISA
      <a class="usa-link" href="https://www.cisa.gov/guidance-applying-june-microsoft-patch-tuesday-update-cve-2022-26925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released guidance on applying the Microsoft patch</a> outlining remediation steps which included applying the patch and turning on a compatibility mode. This compatibility mode is only temporary, and agencies must either manually or determine an automated way to update certificate mapping to a stronger method identified by Microsoft, such as by a subject key identifier. Some agencies took action to have a comparable alternative authenticator as either an ongoing secondary option or as a backup in case there is another potential compromise of PKI validation software or with PKI certificates directly.

## FIDO2 Community of Action

To help support agencies aggressively replace passwords, the Office of Management and Budget, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, and the ICAM Subcommittee established a FIDO2 CoA. The primary characteristics of a CoA are outlined below.

1.	Short-term, usually six months.
2.	Small group, usually 4-8 agencies.
3.	Actively piloting a solution and sharing challenges and lessons learned.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

The first FIDO2 CoA included eight agencies either actively piloting a solution or evolving a pilot to their entire production community. The pilots included a combination of platform authenticators like [Windows Hello for Business](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/playbooks/whfb/) and roaming authenticators like Yubico Yubikey and RSA DS--100.

#### Challenges

1.  **PIV Mentality** - The security approval to use FIDO2 hasn’t been filtered to all levels of agency leadership and operational teams. This is not a PIV versus something else argument, but that authenticator exception policies are a weak link in a security plan.
2.  **Inconsistent user experience** - Although FIDO2 is a specification, vendors can introduce their variations and brands (e.g., the Apple platform authenticator is Face ID, while Android doesn't have a branded name). These small variations can lead to an inconsistent user experience when working in multi-device, operating system, and browser environments. Follow the guidance in this playbook to test across all organization-supported operating systems and browsers and document the process to publish as user stories during your authenticator adoption campaigns. This vendor branding is not unique either. The Federal PIV-I credential also has a similar challenge in how vendors decide to make a PIV-I visually distinct from a PIV.
3.  **Registration and account recovery continue to be an attack vector** - The initial onboarding of an individual is either in-person or through a remote authentication process leveraging a lower assurance authenticator, such as enrolling an email for an OTP to associate a higher assurance authenticator like a phishing-resistant authenticator. Account recovery is the organizational process for users to recover access to their account using a backup authenticator when their primary authenticator is locked, forgotten, or unavailable. An organization's account recovery process often relies on a lower assurance authenticator, such as an email or SMS OTP.
4.  **Technology continues to rely on passwords** - Removing passwords depends more on architecture and technology choices and is a trade-off between mission delivery and budget. Some platforms require passwords even if they are masked and stored in background processes. The only option at some point is to modernize from legacy systems (e.g., Active Directory and Active Directory Federation Services) to modern options that do not require passwords or use passwords in the background.
5.  **Confusing lexicon** - Derived PIV, alternative authenticator, FIDO Token, FIDO Key, WebAuthN Login, different authenticator, Derived FIDO credential, etc. Context is important when using the right terminology. For this playbook, a Derived PIV is defined by NIST Special Publication 800-157 as a credential issued based on proof of possession and control of a PIV Card (soon to be issued based on proofing of a PIV identity account in the newest revision). Any other type of authenticator is an alternative authenticator.

#### Lessons Learned

1.	**No authenticator type is a silver bullet** - Agencies need a holistic authentication strategy to stop handling access exception policies. There is not a single authenticator type that works across all authentication patterns and is phishing-resistant. Agencies must be comfortable with platform-native phishing-resistant authenticators like FIDO2 to replace the most common exception policy alternatives like passwords and OTP that are not phishing-resistant.
2.	**User training and guidance** - Plan and produce user guidance and adoption campaigns. One of the biggest challenges in deploying new technology is ensuring you don’t lose your users on the journey. Hold office hours and Ask Me Anything sessions, or have on-demand videos to help users transition to new tools. See the user experience section of the Windows Hello for Business Playbook as an example.
3.	**Platform authenticator cost advantage** - FIDO2 platform authenticators provide a more straightforward and cost-efficient approach to meeting broader organization adoption of phishing-resistant authentication for all users. Biometric options such as face and finger recognition are supported in FIDO2 without needing 3rd party middleware but depend on device support and using modern access management tools (e.g., not natively supported in legacy tools such as Active Directory, Active Directory Federation Services, mainframes, and Siteminder).
4.	**Challenge your organizational assumptions to be a change leader** - It's very common in large organizations with digital identity functions spread across multiple teams to have a high barrier to change. Many may challenge that anything besides a PIV credential or PKI is the only choice, not including a holistic access perspective of the use of access exception policies. Challenge those assumptions.
5.	**Shared workstations** -

# Run a FIDO2 Pilot

An agency's journey toward a passwordless future typically starts with a pilot. Follow these three steps from the FIDO2 CoA to plan and execute a successful FIDO2 pilot.

[Step 1 - Recognize authentication patterns and use cases](#step-1---recognize-authentication-patterns-and-use-cases) where your agency uses an exception authenticator.<br>
[Step 2 - Identify available solutions](#step-2---identify-available-solutions), which may include procuring FIDO2 security keys.<br>
[Step 3 - Deploy a pilot](#step-3---deploy-a-pilot) and make production considerations.<br>

## Step 1 - Recognize Authentication Patterns and Use Cases

The first step for many agencies is identifying use cases, authentication patterns, and gaps. Through the FIDO2 CoA, five main authentication patterns are identified.

Figure 4. Authentication patterns toward a holistic authenticator strategy
 <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/playbooks/pra-4-patterns.png" align="center" alt="Authentication patterns focus on the authentication events between a user (an employee, contractor, or partner) and data. The five primary authentication patterns inlude unmanaged devices, managed devices, enterprise single sign on tool, direct authentication through a web portal, and a non-application interface such as a command line.">

Figure 4 identifies the five most common authenticator patterns between a user and data and is grouped into two main categories.

**Device authentication** is the first attempt to gain data access. Two device authentication patterns include managed and unmanaged devices.
    1.	**Unmanaged Devices** include any device not under the organization's control. Some agencies support Bring Your Own Device or contractor-furnished device access for a limited number of applications like email or collaboration tools. Deploying or enforcing certificate-based options, compliance profiles, or baseline images is difficult. This is a growing access method as more agencies support unmanaged device access to cloud applications.<br>
    2.	**Managed Devices** include any device under direct control or with a managed profile, such as Government Furnished Equipment (GPE) and contractor-furnished equipment or personal devices with an organizational profile or container. GFE is the primary method most agencies use for data access. One challenge for most agencies is managing many operating system types, which may also limit how certificates are supported.<br>
    
**Application authentication** is often the 2nd authentication attempt to gain data access. Three application authentication patterns include an enterprise Single Sign-On tool, direct access through a web application, or a non-application interface.<br>
    3.	**[Single Sign On (SSO)](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/playbooks/sso/)** - Agencies are centralizing application access using an enterprise SSO tool. This is often where PIV enforcement occurs, with most SSO tools supporting certificate-based authentication.<br>
    4.	**Web Application** - Direct HTTPS authentication at a web page. The most common implementation is partner access use cases across agencies because most organizations have or are centralizing access to their internal applications with an enterprise SSO tool. Certificate-based options are often difficult to support, so most agencies deploy a password or OTP. Some agencies have outsourced authentication to a shared service such as Login.gov.<br>
    5.	**Non-Application Interface** - This is a catch-all for data access, not over HTTPS, such as command line, SSH, or other non–HTTP protocols. Most agencies rely on either [Privileged Access tools](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/playbooks/pam/), Secure Shell (SSH) keys, or passwords with additional network-based access control such as a jump box.<br>


<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--info">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">OPM supplemental credentialing standards.</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      Follow OPM's six basic standards for denying an alternative authentication to individuals who do not meet the time requirement for a suitability determination or security clearance.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The individual is unknown or reasonably suspected of being a terrorist. This includes checking names against law enforcement records.</li>
        <li>The employer cannot verify the individual's claimed identity.</li>
        <li>There is a reasonable basis to believe the individual has submitted fraudulent information concerning their identity. A reasonable basis to believe occurs when a disinterested observer, with knowledge of the same facts and circumstances, would reasonably reach the same conclusion.</li>
        <li>There is a reasonable basis to believe the individual will attempt to gain unauthorized access to classified documents, information protected by the Privacy Act, proprietary information, or other sensitive or protected information.</li>
        <li>There is a reasonable basis to believe the individual will use an identity credential outside the workplace unlawfully or inappropriately.</li> 
        <li>There is a reasonable basis to believe the individual will use Federally-controlled information systems unlawfully, make unauthorized modifications to such systems, corrupt or destroy such systems, or engage in inappropriate uses of such systems.</li>
      </ol>
  </div>
</div>

Once we identify the authenticator gaps, we can identify the primary use cases of our holistic strategy. Four workforce identity use cases and one public identity use case identify where a phishing-resistant option can close those gaps. These are generic use cases that an organization can adopt or modify if fit their mission needs.

**Workforce Identity Use Case**

1.	**Alternative authenticator or “I don’t have a card reader”** - This is the primary use case to replace exception authenticators like passwords or OTPs. This use case includes mobile device or application access where a certificate-based authentication option is unavailable or untenable. Agencies deploy an alternative authenticator like a platform authenticator as an always available option. Some agencies deploy Derived PIV. Another perspective of this use case is a **bring-your-own authenticator** for employees and contractors. Some agency systems can support it, and they've approved specific types of security keys, including contractor-furnished ones. 
2.	**Back–up authenticator or “I don’t have my PIV credential”** - This use case user doesn't have a PIV credential yet, meaning it hasn’t been delivered as a new issuance or a replacement. This use case replaces an exception policy authenticator with a phishing-resistant option until the user has their PIV credential. Some agencies deploy PIV Interoperable or agency-specific alternative tokens as well.
3.	**Ineligible PIV user or “I can’t get a PIV credential”** - This use case covers the user community outside the OPM credentialing standards. This community includes short-term employees, contractors, partners, and users who do not meet the continuous six-month access requirement.  Some agencies deploy PIV Interoperable, agency–specific alternative tokens, or username/password and OTP.
4. **Technology limitations** – Any certificate–based authenticator has challenges and limitations, as outlined in the 101 section. Cloud applications and mobile devices usually do not natively support certificate–based options without 3rd party tools. Partner applications are another example where maintaining a Federal PKI trust store is an untenable activity or creates user friction in using your applications.

**Public Identity Use Case**

1. **Mission application for public users** - The Federal Zero Trust Strategy recognizes that phishing-resistant authenticators are not just a workforce challenge but should also be an option for public users. Agencies should consider adding a phishing–resistant option to public-facing websites.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--info">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Can we support bring your own devices and authenticators?</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      It is an agency risk decision to support BYOD or Bring Your Own Authenticators (BYOA). A BYOA is a user's authenticator that they've personally purchased and controlled. Supporting BYOA is an everyday use case for applications that leverage an external access tool such as Max.gov or Login.gov rather than for an agency enterprise SSO tool. However, some agencies are exploring the benefits and risks of allowing employees to use personal authenticators. Consider data sensitivity when supporting BYOD and BYOA data access. One unique feature of FIDO2 is limiting the types of FIDO authenticators registered with an account. For example, an agency can limit to a specific vendor and batch of security keys (such as only FIPS-certified). 
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## Step 2 - Identify Available Solutions

Most agencies are surprised that their agency enterprise SSO tool supports FIDO2, usually without any additional license or equipment costs. FIDO2 platform and device support require a crosswalk between operating systems and browsers, with some operating systems supporting some browsers and vice versa. FIDO2 platform authenticators are single operating system specific, so they will not work in a multi-operating system use case (e.g., Windows Hello for Business can not be used to authenticate to or on an Apple device). However, some cross-device workflows can enable a FIDO2 platform authenticator on a smartphone to be used to log in via a PC or laptop.  Due to this, the user experience may also be different between operating systems and browsers.

Fortunately, the FIDO Alliance and their supported vendor community have several resources to identify platform and device support in addition to compatibility issues. They also have a growing base of vendor support, and more than 1,000 products have attained [FIDO certification](https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/):target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}. 

Five leading platforms and four browsers support FIDO2 and WebAuthn.
1.	Platform (Operating Systems)
    1.	Windows 10 or later
    2.	Apple MacOS Big Sur (11) or later
    3.	Apple iOS and PadOS 16.3 or later
    4.	Android 7+
    5.	Linux 
2.	Browsers
    1.	Google Chrome
    2.	Apple Safari
    3.	Windows Edge
    4.	Mozilla Firefox

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--info">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">What's the advantage of a platform authenticator versus roaming?</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      Platform authenticators have some cost and user experience advantages over roaming authenticators. They are most likely supported on GFE and provide a more seamless experience than a roaming authenticator if a user only logs into a single device. Roaming authenticators are more widely supported in multi-operating system environments but come with the additional acquisition cost and lifecycle activities that come with a physical authenticator.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

Listing a crosswalk in this playbook may be unable to keep up with the latest operating system and browser updates, so public tools are recommended for verification and testing.

1.	[https://webauthn.io/](https://webauthn.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} is a Cisco / FIDO Alliance sponsored website to test WebAuthn. It also includes shared libraries and languages used to implement WebAuthn in web applications.
2.	[https://webauthn.me/](https://webauthn.me/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} is a Auth0 sponsored website to test and debug WebAuthn. It also includes a compatibility chart of which operating systems and browsers support platforms and roaming authenticators.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--info">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">What about IA–2(6) control enhancement and platform authenticators?</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      NIST 800–53 control enhancement (IA-2(6)) requires that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access. This is not a baseline control but a control enhancement, meaning agencies are not required to implement it, and agencies handle the exception process. While this could mean platform authentication is not separate, another interpretation is the TPM (Windows), TEE (Android), or SE (Apple) on a device is separate from the device itself. Two OMB Memos (M-6-16 and M-7-17) also stated this control enhancement, but both memos were rescinded.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Identify Acquisition Strategy

There are two main patterns to acquiring security keys.

1.	[GSA Advantage](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/ws/main/start_page?_gl=1*1ipxsrg*_ga*MTQ5NDY5NjQxNy4xNjUyMjczMzIw*_ga_HBYXWFP794*MTY4ODE2OTgwMC4xNDQuMC4xNjg4MTY5ODAwLjAuMC4w){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"} is a centralized acquisition portal that also includes FIDO2 security keys. Search for FIDO2 and verify if the vendor meets your requirements, such as FIPS certification. This is a good approach for purchase card or small quantities such as 100 or less.
2.	Some FIDO2 security key vendors provide enterprise contracts with additional benefits such as replacement and discounted pricing. These agreements often require large purchase orders of several hundred to thousands of security keys.

Because of the secure nature of a security key, acquire them from a trusted source and verify the packaging for tampering on receipt.

## Step 3 - Deploy a Pilot

The next natural step is to plan and deploy a pilot. The FIDO2 CoA outlined a six-part pilot plan for a successful pilot. Agencies can add more sections, but these six should be included at least.

1.	Identifying objectives and use cases - This playbook is a great resource to help identify pilot objectives and use cases.
2.	Pilot size and executive support - Identify a pilot user group commensurate with the production population. For most piloting agencies, this was 5%. Ensure your pilot has CIO or CISO support.
3.	Timeline - Pilots range from a couple of months to a year, including all research and planning based on size and complexity. The actual pilot may only run for a couple of weeks.
4.	Pilot team and resources– Identify and engage with all stakeholders, including identifying a pilot lead and support team. For some agencies, this could include multiple teams spread across a network, directory, cloud, HSPD-12, security, and other offices. Also, identify your pilot components such as operating system, access tools, browser, and platform or roaming authenticator types.
5.	Risk and challenges – List your known and anticipated risks and challenges. These can include those listed in this playbook or agency-specific, like resource limitations or user adoption.
6.	Success metrics - There are a range of success metrics. Here are some examples.
    1.	Totally remove passwords from our enterprise SSO tool as an authenticator option.
    2.	Reduce the number of policy exceptions to less than 1%.
    3.	99% of user accounts have more than one phishing-resistant authenticator registered.
    4.	Support two or more phishing-resistant authenticator options.
    5.	Implement a self-service capability.
    6.	Improve user experience survey results by 5%.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--info">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">What is a good pilot size?</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      The FIDO2 CoA advises basing your pilot user size on a cross-section of production users. A good size group is 50-100 users for platform authenticators and half that for roaming authenticators. The intent of a FIDO2 pilot should focus on validating enterprise use cases with an intent to deploy it in production as either an alternative or backup authenticator.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Lifecycle Management

What are the lifecycle management steps of a non-PKI authenticator? This is a widespread question that may be over-analyzed because of the PKI-centric nature of authenticators in the federal government. For specific lifecycle questions regarding Derived PIV authenticators, see [NIST Special Publication 800–157](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-157/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:class="usa-link usa-link--external"}. A FIDO authenticator is registered to an account with most agencies following NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls covering account lifecycle management.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert--info">
  <div class="usa-alert__body">
    <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Is FIDO2 a Derived PIV?</h4>
    <p class="usa-alert__text">
      A Derived PIV is any credential issued based on proof of possession and control of a PIV Card with additional controls as outlined in Special Publication 800-157. If your agency requires proof of possession of a PIV card and implements additional controls before issuing a FIDO2 authenticator, it is a Derived PIV. If your agency doesn’t, then it is not a Derived PIV. A Derived PIV is limited to a digital certificate in the current version of NIST Special Publication 800-157. Still, the next draft version includes non-PKI Authenticator Level 2 and 3 options and associates other authenticators to the PIV identity record rather than just the PIV credential. FIDO2 authenticators are the only standards-based, non-PKI phishing-resistant authenticator for Derived PIV.

There are three lifecycle stages for a non-PKI authenticator, including FIDO.

1.	**Issuance**
    1. FIDO2 roaming or platform authenticators only support hardware-based devices. 
    2. Agencies should follow NIST 800-63 guidance that states a federally-issued authenticator be to a FIPS 140 Level 1 or 2 device. 
    3. Agencies should ensure that the issuance process includes an MFA prompt at the same or higher Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) of the issued authenticator over a secured channel like mutually authenticated HTTPS. 
    4. The authenticator is registered to an identity account in an agency ICAM system following the FIDO2 specification. 
    5. PIN length is recommended as at least six digits.
2.	**Maintenance**
    1. FIDO2 authenticators do not have an expiration date or need to be reissued at set intervals unless they are compromised. 
    2. If the identity account is updated, it is possible that a new FIDO registration must take place.
    3. Platform authenticators may require biometric factors to be updated.
    4. Roaming authenticators that are security keys may require maintenance from normal usage or damage.
3.	**Invalidation** -
    1. A FIDO2 authenticator can not be revoked, but agencies can remove the association between the authentication and the user's account. This can occur if the authenticator is damaged, compromised, or deleted from the user's device. This is similar to removing a certificate mapped to a PIV credential.
    2. If a roaming authenticator can not be recovered, an agency may consider suspending the user's account.

### Best Practices with Biometrics in Authentication

Using a biometric platform authenticator can improve the user's experience and be cost-effective because it leverages native device features. In the future, roaming authenticators may also support a biometric capability. Today's most common platform authenticators include Apple Face ID, Touch ID, and Windows Hello for Business. Android also supports a biometric platform authenticator but does not have a branded name. NIST Special Publication 800-63b outlines best practices when using biometrics as an authentication factor. 
1.	For multi-factor authentication, always and only use a biometric with a physical device (something you have) and never with a knowledge factor (something you know).
2.	The biometric capture device uses a protected channel and is authenticated with the verifier before capturing a biometric.
3.	Operate with a False Match Rate (FMR) or False Accept Rate (FAR) of at least 1 in 1000 (<0.001%).
4.	Biometric systems should implement Presentation Attack Detection (e.g., liveness detection).
5.	Limit the number of failed attempts to five.
6.	Local biometric comparison is preferred over a central verifier.

# Summary

A PIV credential remains the primary authenticator for federal users, but there are modern phishing-resistant options to create a more holistic authenticator strategy. These options include FIDO2 and WebAuthn, but more may be identified in the future. Many agency personnel are surprised that their agency supports these modern options. Agencies can use this playbook to pilot modern authentication options or deploy the technology into production to reduce or altogether remove passwords.
