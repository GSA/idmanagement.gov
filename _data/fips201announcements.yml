- name: GSA FIPS 201 Testing Lab Re-opening
  summary: It is our great pleasure to announce the reopening of the FIPS201 Evaluation Program's compliance testing lab. An email announcing the reopening of the lab was sent out to the community on Wednesday, July 20, 2022. Due to a recent change in contract vehicles the lab had to physically move to a new location. Even though the distance was not far, the move itself was time consuming. We would like to thank those PACS vendors who took the time to certify their current installations prior to the move, and you may be called upon to verify that everything moved over is in working order. You will be contacted by the lab team if further assistance is needed. For those of you who have been waiting to submit new applications, or conduct updates, we appreciate your patience. You are now free to send the paperwork to our group email address <a href="mailto&#58;fips201ep@gsa.gov">fips201ep@gsa.gov</a>.

- name: GSA FIPS 201 Testing Lab Transition Planning
  summary: GSA FICAM Testing Program Vendor - The current contract with the testing services provider for the GSA FICAM Testing Lab concludes on June 15, 2022. We are working to ensure a smooth transition for all our Vendors as we onboard a new provider.During the transition period, please note the following<br><ol><li><b>Vendor Verification of System Health</b> - We ask that each Vendor schedule an in-person appointment with the Lab prior to June 3, 2022, to verify the health of its installed system. Each Vendor representative may test its system during the visit, but updating software and hardware will not be permitted. The Lab will perform a small number of tests from the FRTC during the visit. Results will be documented, signed by Vendor and Lab representatives, and submitted to GSA. For any Vendor that is unable to go to the Lab in person prior to June 3, 2022, the Lab will issue a status report to GSA reflecting the system’s state as “unknown.” Until an in-person visit with the new Lab provider occurs to establish system status, no new applications will be accepted.</li><li><b>Testing in Progress</b> - The Lab is making every effort to complete as much testing as possible before we enter the transition phase. Testing for Vendor systems in process will conclude by May 27, 2022.</li><li><b>New Vendor Applications</b> - Applications received <b>before</b> May 31, 2022, will be reviewed by the existing Lab provider. Applications received <b>after</b> May 31, 2022, will be paused until the new provider is in place.</li><li><b>System Updates and New Installations</b> - System updates and new installations will not be processed until the new Lab provider is in place.<br><br>We will issue an announcement in June detailing next steps in the transition process, including the process of moving existing systems to a new physical location.</li></ol>

- name: PACS APL Application Form Revision
  summary: PACS APL testing form has undergone a major revision.  The new testing APL Application form consolidates multiple documents and reduces redundant information across those forms.  All submissions for upgrade will only need to submit a completed new APL Application form unless a significant change to architecture requires new FRTC per the lab's discretion.

- name: APL Category Removal -- Card Holders
  summary: The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program will be removing card holders (also known as badge holders or electromagnetically opaque sleeves) from the Approved Products List on January 31st, 2021. GSA will no longer accept applications to certify card holders. Card holders and related products are still commercially available off-the-shelf; however, the use of these products is optional and testing is no longer in the best interests of the government.<br><br>Please note the removal of this category should not impact any existing acquisitions. Product categories not identified by the Program have no requirement for FIPS 201 conformance and available products should be able to satisfy the agency defined security requirements provided direct testing.

- name: APL Category Removal - OCSP and SCVP
  summary: The FIPS 201 Evaluation program has removed the following categories from the Approved Products List. After analyzing the Approved Products List categories, the program found the following.<br><br>- OCSP Responders are mature. OCSP responders and related products are available as commercial off the shelf products and open source software products. They are part of a stable landscape and vetted thousands of times daily by various relying party applications. It is not in the government’s or commercial best interests to continue to test these products prior to acquisition and/or installation.<br><br>- SCVP Client and SCVP Client (without auth) are not widely used in U.S. federal agencies. It is not in the government’s or commercial best interests to continue to maintain testing scenarios for these products.<br><br>Please note the removal of these categories should not impact any acquisition. Categories not identified by the program have no requirement for FIPS 201 conformance. Products on the market should be reviewed for adherence to standard U.S. federal cryptographic conformance requirements (i.e., FIPS 140-2) and trade laws (i.e., country of origin and Trade Agreements Act). Products are available to satisfy federal agency’s needs and requirements.

- name: APL Category Removal - RNG--based PIV cards
  summary: In-line with the DRBG PIV credential transition plan from NIST, the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program will be removing legacy RNG PIV credential listed on the Approved Products List on July 31, 2017. According to this transition plan, agencies may continue to procure and issue credentials using implementations marked as “legacy” on the NPIVP validation list until June 30, 2017. However, the agencies should migrate to fully compliant credentials implementing approved DRBGs as soon as DRBG PIV credential and the compatible credential management software are commercially available. Once issued, these “legacy” RNG PIV credentials may be used until their expiration date – up to June 30, 2023.

- name: APL Category Removal - Tri-Interface PIV card
  summary: The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program received and analyzed multiple comments on the removal of tri-interface credentials from the Approved Products List. To provide further clarification, tri-interface credentials refers to PIV credentials that have additional non-PIV authentication features such as a mag stripe and 125 kHz antenna. The Program has been asked to remove these types of credentials from the APL because they have become an enabler for some buildings to postpone or altogether avoid deploying compliant Physical Access Control Systems (PACS); our intent was to close this loophole. Two years ago, the Program removed transparent readers from the APL to align products with policy and standards by utilizing PKI for PACS and LACS. We are now removing tri-interface credentials from the APL so buildings can migrate away from legacy forms of access control and align with policy and directives. While we received mostly very positive feedback about this decision, we have received feedback that highlighted a number of legitimate use cases that we would be negatively impacting agencies. The Program is going to delay the removal of the tri-interface credentials from the APL from 6 to 18 months. In 18 months the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program will no longer test or list tri-interface credentials on the APL. <strong>Note that PIV Issuers are required to use APL approved credential stock, so beginning in 18 months issuance of tri-interface PIV credentials will not be allowed</strong>.
