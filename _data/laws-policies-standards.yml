    This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides guidelines for 
    applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. The RMF provides a disciplined, 
    structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information 
    security categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and 
    common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. The RMF includes activities to 
    prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. The 
    RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and 
    common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring 
    processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make 
    efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions 
    and business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life 
    cycle. Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to 
    risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility 
    and accountability for the controls implemented within an organization's information systems 
    and inherited by those systems.

    Institute), based on an expanded corpus of more than 1,500 insider threat cases and continued 
    research and analysis. It introduces the topic of insider threats, describes its intended audience, 
    outlines changes for this edition, defines insider threats, and outlines current trends. The guide 
    then describes 21 practices that organizations should implement to prevent and detect insider 
    threats, as well as case studies of organizations that failed to do so.

    so they can implement ICAM using consistent, standards-based methodologies. Second, as a 
    descriptive document, it supports DoD Components in understanding how to consume DoD enterprise 
    ICAM services and how to operate DoD Component, Community of Interest (COI), or local level 
    ICAM services when DoD enterprise services do not meet mission needs.

    U.S. Government Agencies and their partners who want to integrate secure alternatives to 
    PIV-based authentication need to support authorized users who will be employing personally 
    owned or partner-owned devices, such as smart phones and home or non-government office computers, 
    to access government or partner information systems containing sensitive information. By using 
    the objective criteria in this guidance, government organizations can make better informed 
    decisions about which multi-factor solutions meet their particular needs. And by following 
    the practical guidelines, users can reduce their risk exposure and become harder targets for 
    malicious threat actors.
