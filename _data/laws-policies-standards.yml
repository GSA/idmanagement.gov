    These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services 
    and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline 
    focuses on the use of federated identity and the use of assertions to implement identity federations. 
    Federation allows a given CSP to provide authentication and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number 
    of separately-administered relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use more than one CSP.

    This Memorandum contains general guidance for the planning, identification, categorization, 
    prioritization, reporting, assessment, and remediation of Federal High Value Assets (HV As), as 
    well as the handling of information related to HV As by the Federal Government. It also outlines 
    the responsibilities of Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Office of 
    Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Homeland Security (DRS), and General 
    Services Administration (GSA). The HVA initiative outlined in this memorandum is an ongoing 
    government-wide activity intended to evolve over time.

  description: >
    With the creation of the HVA initiative in 2015, the federal government's CFO Act agencies took a pivotal 
    step toward the identification of its most critical assets. DHS, in coordination with OMB, established a 
    capability to assess agency HVAs, resulting in the identification of critical areas of weakness and plans 
    to remediate those areas of weakness. It established three possible categories for designating federal 
    information or a federal information system as an HVA: Informational Value, Mission Essential, or Federal 
    Civilian Enterprise Essential (FCEE). It also updates the required approach for agencies to report, assess, 
    and remediate HVAs to protect against cyberattacks.

    This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides guidelines for 
    applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. The RMF provides a disciplined, 
    structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information 
    security categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and 
    common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. The RMF includes activities to 
    prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. The 
    RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and 
    common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring 
    processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make 
    efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions 
    and business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life 
    cycle. Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to 
    risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility 
    and accountability for the controls implemented within an organization's information systems 
    and inherited by those systems.
