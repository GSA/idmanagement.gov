    methodology in which authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes 
    associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment conditions 
    against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given set of attributes.

    The Risk Management Framework provides a process that integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply 
    chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. The risk-based approach to 
    control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to 
    applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations. Managing 
    organizational risk is paramount to effective information security and privacy programs; the RMF approach 
    can be applied to new and legacy systems, any type of system or technology (e.g., IoT, control systems), 
    and within any type of organization regardless of size or sector.

  description: >-
    This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides guidelines for 
    applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. The RMF provides a disciplined, 
    structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information 
    security categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and 
    common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. The RMF includes activities to 
    prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. The 
    RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and 
    common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring 
    processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make 
    efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions 
    and business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life 
    cycle. Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to 
    risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility 
    and accountability for the controls implemented within an organization's information systems 
    and inherited by those systems.

    in digital or non-digital form, through a complete lifecycle from data collection through disposal.
