A communication plan outlines an Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program's objectives, goals, themes, and approach. You should create a communication plan early in the life cycle to communicate consistently and effectively with users and stakeholders.

The following table includes a summary of some common communication activities you should prioritize in your program.

| <center> Communication Description </center> | <center> Target Audience </center> | <center> Delivery Media </center> |
|----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------:|:---------:|
| Educational resources for stakeholders and users | Various stakeholder groups | Website, Collaboration portal |
| Ad hoc updates for system rollout events and changes | User population | Email, newsletter bulletin |
| Leadership briefing highlighting objectives and status | Agency leadership | Slide presentation, meeting |
| Messages from leadership | ICAM implementers | Memo, email |
| Awareness materials explaining workstream features and milestones | User population | Social media, videos, brochures, posters |
| Lessons-learned workshops | ICAM implementers | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |
| Large-scale gathering (agency ICAM conference or all-hands) | ICAM implementers, User population | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |

You should tailor the messages and delivery methods to the stakeholders. The goal of this plan is to inform and involve stakeholders by providing regular and well-structured communications, to foster and maintain stakeholder support and reduce risk.
