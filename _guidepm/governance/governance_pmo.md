In addition to a program governance body, you can support the execution and operation of projects and workstreams with a Program Management Office (PMO).

An Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) PMO complements the program governance body. Some agencies may not require both a program governance body and a PMO; however, larger agencies may need to separate governance and operational responsibility for effective ICAM operations. A PMO helps ensure that the individual components of the ICAM program operate efficiently and achieve the expected results within the defined budget and schedule.

For a PMO to be effective, it must:

- Be chartered to perform the functions as needed.
- Have the skills and expertise to implement the ICAM program.
- Have the support of executive leadership.
- Be allowed to use resources as required.

## PMO Roles and Responsibilities

The PMO will typically be responsible for the following functions:

- Coordinate implementation efforts across ICAM stakeholders and component agency programs, for example:
    - Identity management
    - Credentialing 
    - Access management: physical access control systems (PACS)
    - Access management: application access
    - Personnel security
- Maintain an enterprise ICAM perspective to ensure all component agency programs align with organizational objectives.
- Serve as a centralized point of contact for ICAM questions, issues, and concerns.
- Plan for and secure program funding to execute ICAM capabilities.
- Handle communications and outreach to both internal and external stakeholders.
- Manage and resolve program risks and issues across agency office, component, or bureau boundaries.

If your agency separates physical and logical security into separate offices, consider forming an ICAM guidance body with representation from each office to serve the function of a PMO.

## PMO Governance Structure

PMOs generally follow standardized project management policies, processes, and methods. Within ICAM, a PMO facilitates communication, including sharing lessons learned inside and outside the agency. It may also serve as an advisor to other agency offices or programs impacted by the ICAM program on addressing ICAM as appropriate within other agency-wide capabilities. An ICAM PMO acts as a central point of contact for the agency's ICAM program. The PMO is the primary authority to perform acquisition planning tasks and make procurement decisions.

The figure below represents a sample ICAM PMO structure. An agency should design this structure in a way that fosters communication, coordinates efforts, and aligns appropriately with the agency's overall organizational structure.
