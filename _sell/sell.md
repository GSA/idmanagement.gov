Federal agencies require systems and services to be functional, secure, and compatible with other products. The General Services Administration supports these requirements through testing and identifying products and services.
- The GSA Federal Acquisition Service  issues long-term governmentwide contracts that provide federal, state, and local government buyers access to commercial products, services and solutions at pre negotiated pricing.
- The GSA Office of Government Policy provides testing and certification services for specific product categories.

In most cases, vendors who wish to sell Identity, Credentialing, and Access Management products or services to the federal government apply to a Multiple Award Schedule Special Item Number. Vendors must submit an appropriate self-assessment that demonstrates policy compliance with the following directives or standards.
- [Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)](https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-presidential-directive-12).
- [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/). 
- [NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/201/3/final).

Two product categories require additional testing at a testing facility before applying to the Multiple Award Schedule.
1. Smart card credentials require testing by GSA or an approved lab. Products are listed on the [GSA FIPS 201 Approved Products List - PIV Cards](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-piv/) category.
2. Physical Access Control Systems for buildings, including readers and infrastructure require testing by GSA. Products are listed on the [GSA FIPS 201 Approved Products List - Physical Access Control System Components](https://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list-pacs-products/) category.

Please get in touch with fips201ep at gsa.gov if you have product approval questions.

Additionally, the GSA FICAM Program established a FICAM Product Criteria to help agencies identify commercially-tested digital identity products. There is one category.
1. [Phishing Resistant Authenticators]({{site.baseurl}}/buy/product-criteria#phishing-resistant-authenticators/)

See the [Product Criteria](({{site.baseurl}}/sell/ficampc/) on how to submit your product. Please get in touch with ICAM at gsa.gov for product criteria questions.

## Product Approval Process

It only takes three steps to get a product approved for federal use. **If your product does not require additional testing under one of the categories listed above, skip to step 3.**

1. Review testing documents
2. Contact a testing lab
3. Get on a GSA Schedule

### Step 1 – Review Testing Documents

The GSA [FIPS 201 Evaluation Program](../../fips201/), tests [commercial products](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/2.101){:target="_blank"}{:rel= "noopener noreferrer"} used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems and Physical Access Control Systems (PACS).

[Review testing documents and procedures](../../fips201/)

### Step 2 – Contact a Testing Lab

Once you've reviewed the testing documents, contact one of the Testing Labs listed below. They'll walk you through the application and testing process.

Three Approved Testing Labs test PIV card stock:
- [atsec information security corporation](http://www.atsec.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
  - Contact: Andreas Fabis
  - Phone: (512) 615-7300
- [Booz Allen Hamilton Cyber Assurance Testing Laboratory](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/testing_labs/#24){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
  - Contact:  Eric Winterton
  - Phone: (410) 684-6691
- [Leidos](https://www.leidos.com/CC-FIPS140){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
  - Contact: Michael Powers
  - Phone: (443) 367-7422

GSA manages testing and certification for Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) as well as annual audit testing of production PIV credentials for federal agencies:

- GSA FICAM Testing Lab
  - Contact: fips201ep at gsa.gov

If your product completes the testing process, two things occur.
1) You'll receive a signed approval document.
2) Product listed on the [Approved Products List (APL)](../buy#products) under the appropriate category.

After testing and approval, apply for your product or service to get listed on the GSA's Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).

### Step 3 – Get on a GSA Schedule

The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program also referred to as the "Schedule," is the premier contract vehicle for the federal government. The Schedule Program is a long-term government-wide contract between commercial suppliers and the federal government. Holding a Schedule contract can open doors for a business, but it requires effort and commitment to succeed. [See if the Schedule is a good fit for your business first.](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedule/selling-through-schedule/prospective-schedule-contractors-is-the-schedule-a-good-fit-for-me){:target= "_blank"}{:rel= "noopener noreferrer"}

- [Sell through GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS)](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100519){:target="_blank"}{:rel= "noopener noreferrer"}  – Agencies use the MAS to fulfill their technology products and services needs.

## Professional Services

Professional services involve integrating solutions and helping agencies deploy and operate identity and credentialing systems related to ICAM implementations. Professional services vendors must document their experience deploying policy-compliant ICAM projects in government agencies. GSA certifies consulting services and labor categories through Special Item Numbers for ICAM or HSPD-12 professional services. Don't hesitate to contact fpki at gsa.gov if you have professional service questions.
