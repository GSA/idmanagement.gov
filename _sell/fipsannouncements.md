# Category Removed from the APL December 2020

POSTED December 11, 2020

The FIPS 201 Evaluation program will be removing card holders (also known as badge holders or electromagnetically opaque sleeves) from the Approved Products List on January 31st, 2021. GSA will no longer accept applications to certify card holders. Card holders and related products are still commercially available off-the-shelf; however, the use of these products is optional and testing is no longer in the best interests of the government.

Please note the removal of this category should not impact any existing acquisitions. Product categories not identified by the Program have no requirement for FIPS 201 conformance and available products should be able to satisfy the agency defined security requirements provided direct testing.

# Category Removed from the APL April 2019

POSTED April 30, 2019

The FIPS 201 Evaluation program has removed the following categories from the [Approved Products List](../../buy#products). After analyzing the Approved Products List categories,the program found that:

- OCSP Responders are mature. OCSP responders and related products are available as commercial off the shelf products and open source software products. They are part of a stable landscape and vetted thousands of times daily by various relying party applications. It is not in the government’s or commercial best interests to continue to test these products prior to acquisition and/or installation.
- SCVP Client and SCVP Client (without auth) are not widely used in US federal agencies. It is not in the government’s or commercial best interests to continue to maintain testing scenarios for these products.

Please note the removal of these categories should not impact any acquisition. Categories not identified by the program have no requirement for FIPS 201 conformance. Products on the market should be reviewed for adherence to standard US federal cryptographic conformance requirements (i.e. FIPS 140-2) and trade laws (i.e. country of origin and Trade Agreements Act). Products are available to satisfy federal agency’s needs and requirements.

## Category Removed from the APL June 2018

POSTED June 30, 2018

In the past, the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program has granted extensions for allowing RNG-based PIV cards to continue being listed on the APL. In alignment with [NIST’s decision](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST-Personal-Identity-Verification-Program/Announcements){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program has also decided to not grant another extension and has removed all RNG-based PIV cards from the APL and added them to our [Removed Products List](../../buy/removed-products-list/).

## Categories Removed from the APL October 2016

POSTED October 29, 2016

The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program has removed the following categories, displayed in the table to the right, from the [Approved Products List](../../buy#products). After analyzing the Approved Products List categories, the Program found that:

- Many products on the APL are not for sale anymore
- Most testing and approval procedures were outdated
- Testing was already being conducted by some other Program (NIST, FBI)

Below are some resources that provide information, guidance, or a replacement certification list for some of the removed FIPS 201 categories:

- Guidance through the [FICAM Playbooks](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- Certified lists through other Programs such as NIST’s Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP) for [PIV Middleware](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST-Personal-Identity-Verification-Program/Validation-Lists/SP-800-73-4-PIV-Middleware-Validation-List){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [PIV Credential Applications](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/validation_lists/PIVCardApplicationValidationList.htm){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}; NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) which includes a [FIPS 140-2 validation list](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Category Removed from the APL June 2016

POSTED June 23, 2016

In-line with the [DRBG PIV credential transition plan from NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/announcements.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program will be removing legacy RNG PIV credential listed on the [Approved Products List](../../buy#products) on July 31, 2017.

According to this transition plan, agencies may continue to procure and issue credentials using implementations marked as “legacy” on the [NPIVP validation list](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/validation_lists/PIVCardApplicationValidationList.htm){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} until June 30, 2017. However, the agencies should migrate to fully compliant credentials implementing approved DRBGs as soon as DRBG PIV credential and the compatible credential management software are commercially available. Once issued, these “legacy” RNG PIV credentials may be used until their expiration date – up to June 30, 2023.

## Category Removed from the APL June 2014

POSTED June 13, 2014

The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program received and analyzed multiple comments on the removal of tri-interface credentials from the [Approved Products List (APL)](../../buy#products). To provide further clarification, tri-interface credentials refers to PIV credentials that have additional non-PIV authentication features such as a mag stripe and 125 kHz antenna. The Program has been asked to remove these types of credentials from the APL because they have become an enabler for some buildings to postpone or altogether avoid deploying compliant Physical Access Control Systems (PACS); our intent was to close this loophole. Two years ago, the Program removed transparent readers from the APL to align products with policy and standards by utilizing PKI for PACS and LACS. We are now removing tri-interface credentials from the APL so buildings can migrate away from legacy forms of access control and align with policy and directives.

While we received mostly very positive feedback about this decision, we have received feedback that highlighted a number of legitimate use cases that we would be negatively impacting agencies. The Program is going to delay the removal of the tri-interface credentials from the APL from 6 to 18 months. In 18 months the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program will no longer test or list tri-interface credentials on the APL. **Note that PIV Issuers are required to use APL approved credential stock, so beginning in 18 months issuance of tri-interface PIV credentials will not be allowed.**
